# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

Loans are one of the most imporatant source of income for a bank. An intense procedure of verification and validation should be done befor granting the loan to a candidate as the main profit comes directly from the loanâ€™s interest. This project aims to predict the eligibility of an applicant for getting the loan. 
The steps followed are:
- Gathering the data
 -The dataset(for both training and testing of model) is downloaded from Kaggle and are also provided in this repository.
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Try different machine learning models
 -Logistic Regression, Support vector machine
-Traing the ML Model
- Predicting the eligibility

For cleaning the data so that it is reliable, firstly import the required packages. Then keenly understand the data and the relation between different features of the data. Then clean the data by filling the null values, encoding the categorical data, dealing with outliers. And once the data is clean different visualizations are observed to see on what features the output relies. 
As this is a binary classification problem support vector machine and linear regression models are used and performance metrices like accuracy score, confusion matrix, recall, precision, and roc curve are used to evaluate the model.
